Feedspace API uses Bearer tokens for authentication. You must obtain an access token via the `/oauth/token` endpoint and include it in the `Authorization` header for all API requests.

⚠️ **Remember that your access token is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Access tokens should be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service on the server.

Tokens should be provided via the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### How to Obtain a Token

To obtain an access token, use the `/oauth/token` endpoint with your credentials. See the [Login](/api-reference/Auth/login) documentation for details.

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://api.feedspace.io/v3/{ENDPOINT} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

All API endpoints require authentication using a valid Bearer token.
